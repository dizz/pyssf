Platform - Service Sharing Facility (SSF)

--------
PREREQUISITES
--------
Needed to building and installing SSF are:

  * Swig
  * Python (> 2.6) with distutils
  * GCC
  * Platform LSF (> 7.0.6)

For developing with SSF you can use:

  * Sphinx for building documents
  * Eclipse with PyDev for coding
  * Nosetest for easy unit testing
  * Firefox to view the kanban board (misc/platform_ssf_kanban.html)

--------
TESTING
--------
Either run nosetests or the testsuite.py file in the tests/ directory. You might
need to add the build _lsf.so file to the PYTHONPATH (In my case: 
build/lib.linux-i686-2.6/pylsf)
