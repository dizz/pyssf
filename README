Service Sharing Facility (SSF)

--------
Summary
--------
This software package is a collection of modules which form an uniform
integration point for Grid/Cloud/Cluster products. If provides several
front-ends which can easily be used to build complete Services or integrate
products with your products. It aims to deliver an distributed ecosystem where
multiple Grid/Cloud/Clusters sites can federate. It is developed under a LGPL
license for the DGSI Project.

--------
BUILDING
--------
Normally a 'python setup.py build' should do. The 'dist' target will also work
and build all modules including the SWIG and GCC runs needed for pyLSF. There 
is no need to run make. Although you can build the pyLSF module using the 
Makefile if you want. 

--------
PREREQUISITES
--------
Needed to building and installing SSF are:

  * Swig
  * Python (> 2.6) with distutils
  * GCC
  * Platform LSF (> 7.0.6)

For developing with SSF you can use:

  * Sphinx for building documents (python-sphinx)
  * Eclipse with PyDev for coding
  * Nosetest for easy unit testing (python-nose)
  * Firefox to view the kanban board (misc/platform_ssf_kanban.html)
  * make to build standalone documentation and pylsf shared library

--------
TECHNICAL NOTES
--------
The following paths are configured and you might need to take a look at them
if you encounter any problems:

  * library_dirs in setup.py which should point to the lib dir of the Platform
    LSF installation (Default set to /opt/lsf/7.0/linux2.6-glibc2.3-x86_64/lib)

  * include statements in lsf.i in the pylsf module - Should point to the
    concrete files in the Platform LSF installation. (Defaults set to 
    /opt/lsf/7.0/include/lsf/lsf.h and /opt/lsf/7.0/include/lsf/lsbatch.h)

  * The library directory in the Makefile of the pyLSF module if you want to 
    build it stand alone. No need to change it when building using setup.py 
    script. Default is set to /opt/lsf/7.0/linux2.6-glibc2.3-x86_64/lib. 

--------
TESTING
--------
Either run nosetests or the testsuite.py file in the tests/ directory. You 
might need to add the build _lsf.so file to the PYTHONPATH (In my case: 
build/lib.linux-i686-2.6/pylsf)
