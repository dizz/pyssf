The pydrmaa package
===================
This package has some modules helping to implement a RESTful [DRMAAv2]_
interface.

Job module
----------
The Job modules holds models and factories.

Job
^^^
A simple job modeled after the JobTemplate in the DRMAAv2 Specification.

Currently the job has the following attributes and methods:

 * Attributes: remoteCommand, args
 * Methods: terminate(), get_state()
 
Job Factory
^^^^^^^^^^^
Returns a job object based on some decisions. For now it returns DRMAA Jobs.

DRMAA Job
^^^^^^^^^
Derived from Job class. Uses DRMAA (v1) to submit jobs. Currently supports
Oracle Grid Engine's DRMAA implementation [OGE]_ as well as FedStage's DRMAA
for Platform LSF implementation [LSF_DRMAA]_ (Version 1.0.3). It uses the
drmaa-python [PY_DRMAA]_ package which is therefore a prerequisite.

.. note::
    When using pydrmaa ensure the the DRMAA_LIBRARY_PATH is set. This is needed
    when running the service or the tests.

LSF Job
^^^^^^^
Derived from Job class. Uses the pylsf module to actually execute the commands.

Simple job submission using LSF Job
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

::

    command = '/bin/sleep'
    args = ['100']
    job = JobFactory().create_job(command, args)
    state = job.get_state()
    job.terminate()
