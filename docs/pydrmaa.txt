The pydrmaa package
===================
This package has some modules helping to implement a RESTful [DRMAAv2]_
interface.

Structure of the pydrmaa package
--------------------------------
The Job module holds models and factories.

Job
^^^
A simple job modeled after the JobTemplate in the DRMAAv2 Specification.

Currently the job has the following attributes and methods:

 * Attributes: remoteCommand, args
 * Methods: terminate(), get_state()
 
Job Factory
^^^^^^^^^^^
Returns a job object based on some decisions. For now it returns DRMAA Jobs.

DRMAA Job
^^^^^^^^^
Derived from Job class. Uses DRMAA (v1) to submit jobs. Currently supports
Oracle Grid Engine's DRMAA implementation [OGE]_ as well as FedStage's DRMAA
for Platform LSF implementation [LSF_DRMAA]_ (Version 1.0.3). It uses the
drmaa-python [PY_DRMAA]_ package which is therefore a prerequisite.

.. note::
    When using pydrmaa ensure the the DRMAA_LIBRARY_PATH is set. This is needed
    when running the service or the tests.

LSF Job
^^^^^^^
Derived from Job class. Uses the pylsf module to actually execute the commands.

A simple job submission
-----------------------

::

    command = '/bin/sleep'
    args = ['100']
    job = JobFactory().create_job(command, args)
    state = job.get_state()
    job.terminate()
    
When using pydrmaa with LSF
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
To setup LSF in in such an environment you need to edit 
*/etc/ld.so.conf.d/lsf.conf* and add the value of the $LSF_LIBDIR environment
variable to this file. Finally run the **ldconfig** command.

In the next step you need to symbolically link lsf.conf to /etc/lsf.conf.
Therefore do a **ln -s <path to lsf>/conf/lsf.conf /etc/**

Some variables need to be added to the lsf.conf file::

    LSF_BINDIR=<path to lsf>/7.0/linux2.6-glibc2.3-x86_64/bin
    LSF_ENVDIR=<path to lsf>/conf
    LSF_LIBDIR=<path to lsf>/7.0/linux2.6-glibc2.3-x86_64/lib
    LSF_SERVERDIR=<path to lsf>/7.0/linux2.6-glibc2.3-x86_64/etc

.. note::
    Make sure that you update the paths according to the platform architecture
    you run.
