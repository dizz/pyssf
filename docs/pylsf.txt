The pylsf package
=================
The pylsf package uses [SWIG]_ to create an python interface for the LSF APIs.
It can either be build stand alone using the Makefile or it can be build with
the default build mechanisms of the overall SSF project (python setup.py
build).

A simple job submission
-----------------------
The next paragraph is a code sample for submitting a job using pylsf::

    from pylsf import lsf
    
    def run_job(command):
        """
        Run a job...
        """
        submitreq = lsf.submit()
        submitreq.command = command
        submitreq.options = 0
        submitreq.options2 = 0
    
        limits = []
        for i in range (0, lsf.LSF_RLIM_NLIMITS):
            limits.append(lsf.DEFAULT_RLIMIT)
    
        submitreq.rLimits = limits
    
        submitreq.beginTime = 0
        submitreq.termTime = 0
        submitreq.numProcessors = 1
        submitreq.maxNumProcessors = 1
    
        submitreply = lsf.submitReply()
    
        if lsf.lsb_init("test") > 0:
            exit(1)
    
        job_id = lsf.lsb_submit(submitreq, submitreply)
        return job_id
    
    if __name__ == '__main__':
        print("LSF Clustername is :", lsf.ls_getclustername())
        run_job("/bin/sleep 10")
