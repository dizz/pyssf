Notes on Backend Implementations
--------------------------------

.. note::
    A Backend must handle all the kinds it defines. That means that if it
    defines a compute kind and a network resource link kind all the operations
    should have an 'if statement' to check which type of entity is provided to
    the routine.

.. note::
    If a backend handles mixins it should verify that mixins can be applied to
    the provided resources.

It is recommended to throw AttributeError on issues...Will translate in Bad
Request...

The OCCI implementation eventually calls all the backends associated to an
resource. If a resource has 2 mixins associated to it, the implementation will
call the backend which defines the kind, and the backends which define the
mixins. So in total 3 calls are made. So 3 different backends are used when
each define a single kind - But 1 backend is called 3x times when the backend
defines all 3 types.
