The occi package
================

This package provides an OCCI compatible front-end which can easily be
integrated with any Resource Management Framework (e.g. a Hypervisor - but not
strictly bound to that).

The package here provides an OCCI compatible service and takes care of:

  * A WSGI application which can run on most web frameworks for Python,
  * Easy to extend OCCI interface - you can add your own OCCI extension, hook
    it up to different Resource Management Frameworks or even define own
    renderings,
  * An OCCI compatible interface (Support text/occi, text/plain and
    text/uri-list),
  * A dynamically updated capabilities query interface,
  * Support for collections, mixins, templating and actions as defined by OCCI,
  * Renderings which are defined by OCCI,
  * A simple HTML interface for simple browsing using any Web browser.

Creating an OCCI Service
------------------------

Creating a OCCI compatible service is simple. Write a Backend and associate a
Kind, Mixin or Action with it. The Backend is the glue between the OCCI
front-end and you Resource Management Framework. Every OCCI type definition
needs and corresponding backend which will handle the operations.

This can either mean to implement one backend which can handle several OCCI
types; or to implement a backend for each OCCI type::

    from occi.backend import ActionBackend, KindBackend
    from occi.core_model import Action, Kind, Mixin, Resource
    from occi.wsgi import Application


    class MyBackend(KindBackend, ActionBackend):
        '''
        TODO: This needs to be implemented!

        Will implement create, retrieve, update, delete, replace
        Will also implement: action (from ActionBackend).
        '''

        pass

    class MyMixinBackend(MixinBackend):
        '''
        TODO: This needs to be implemented!

        Will implement create, retrieve, update, delete, replace
        '''

        pass

    if __name__ == '__main__':
        mykind = Kind('http://example.com/occi#',
                      'mykind',
                      title='A OCCI kind...',
                      attributes={'occi.example.attr': '',
                                  'occi.compute.state': 'immutable',
                                  'occi.compute.mandatory': 'required'},
                      related=[Resource.kind],
                      actions=[])

        mymixin = Mixin('http://example.com/occi#', 'mykind', '/my_stuff/')

        kind_backend = MyBackend()
        mixin_backend = MyMixinBackend()

        app = Application()
        app.register_backend(mykind, backend)
        app.register_backend(mymixin, mixin_backend)

The OCCI service itself is an `WSGI <http://www.wsgi.org/>`_ application which
can run on most Web servers our there. And now that the WSGI application is
defined (as *app*) we only need to run it. This can be done with the *wsgiref*
implementation which comes with the standard Python distribution::

    httpd = make_server('', 8888, app)
    httpd.serve_forever()

Or if you would like to use other frameworks such as
`Tornado <http://www.tornadoweb.org/>`_ (Or any other which supports the WSGI
framework)::

    container = tornado.wsgi.WSGIContainer(app)
    http_server = tornado.httpserver.HTTPServer(container)
    http_server.listen(8888)
    tornado.ioloop.IOLoop.instance().start()

After running this example the service will be up and running on port 8888.
You can visit it by going to localhost:8888.

For a more detailed example see the file *run_iaas_wsgi_service.py* in the misc
folder.

Implementing a self written registry
------------------------------------

(Optional) The implementation of a registry is optional. The registry is a
container for the current resources and renderings which are available within
the service. By default the service will use a non persistent registry which
uses dictionaries. This might be sub-optimal since their are many lookups
needed. The use of a simple Database (like Python's build-in sqlite) might be
a faster and better solution for large deployments.

To defined an own registry implement the routines from the abstract class
*Registry*. When instantiating the service provide the registry::

    app = Application(registry=MyRegistry())

Defining your own or other renderings
-------------------------------------

(Optional) You can add your own set of Renderings to your Service if you like.
For example to add support for `OVF <http://www.dmtf.org/standards/ovf>`_ or
`JSON <http://www.json.org/>`_ feel free to add those rendering on your own::

    my_registry = NonePersistentRegistry()
    renderings = {'text/json': JsonRendering(registry)}
    app = Application(renderings=renderings)

Please note that your rendering implementation should derive from the
*Rendering* class. You do not necessarily need to implement all functions
defined in that class but you are encouraged to do so. For more details review
the OCCI and HTML rendering which come along within this package.

.. note::
    The HTMLRendering can be customized with an own CSS to adapt your look and
    feel when using Web browsers. Simply provide a CSS as a string when calling
    the HTMLRenderings's constructor.

Implementing backends
---------------------

.. note::
    Please also check the API documentation.

In general backends handle types of resources - whenever a resource (of the
type which the backend is registered for) gets modified, it is called with the
resource as parameter.

.. note::
    Backends always have the last word - if a resource cannot be created,
    retrieved, updated, replace or delete it will not be done by the service.
    Simply throw an AttributeError. (Same for Action and Mixin Backends)

3 Types of Backends exists (KindBackend, MixinBackend and ActionBackend).
Those who are capable of handling resource of type OCCI Kind. Those who handle
OCCI Mixins and those who can handle Actions.

Thanks to the multiple inheritance features of python you can create a Backend
which handles the resources of a type as well as the actions which can be
performed on the resources. To do so simple derive from the KindBackend and
ActionBackend class.

A Backend is always presented the current state of the resource. The
implementor does not need to modify the attributes 'links' and 'mixins' of the
entity. Those are handled by the service. Only the 'attributes' dictionary
itself should be modified accordingly. It is recommend to add necessary
attributes to this dictionary during create. Also do not forget to set the
currently applicable actions in the 'actions' list of an entity.

When Backends get called
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

The following listing shows when and which function is called on a KindBackend
or MixinBackend:

========  ====================================================================
Routine   Description
========  ====================================================================
create    Called when a resource or link is create. It is recommended to set
          all necessary attributes (like the state) and applicable actions in
          this routine.
retrieve  Called when a resource or link is to be retrieved. Implementors can
          request up to date information from the Resource Management
          Framework and assign it to the resource (like updating the state or
          reviewing the applicable actions).
update    Called when a resource or link needs to updated. New information is
          provided in the new entity. Note that the the new entity does not
          need to be a complete representation of the resource.
replace   Called when a resource or link get replaced. Also see 'update' - but
          this time the new entity is a complety representation.
delete    Called when a resource or link get deleted.
========  ====================================================================

The following routines are called on Backends deriving from Action Backend:

=======  =====================================================================
Routine  Description
=======  =====================================================================
action   Called when an action is performed on the resource. Implementors
         might want to check the and update the attributes (like the state)
         of the resource.
=======  =====================================================================

The OCCI implementation eventually calls all the backends associated to an
resource. If a resource has 2 mixins associated to it, the implementation will
call the backend which defines the kind, and the backends which define the
mixins. So in total 3 calls are made.

To give another example: When a resource is created which has links assigned
the 'create' routines for the backend defining the kind of the resource is
called; the backends for the assigned mixins of the resource are called; as
well as backends defining the links kinds get called called. So if a resource
has 1 kind, 2 mixins and 2 links --> 5 calls on backends are performed.

Passing extra information to the backends
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

To pass information to the backends it is possible to override the *__call__*
function in the WSGI OCCI application. This is useful to pass on security
information to the backends for example::

    def __call__(self, environ, response):
        sec_obj = {'username': 'password'}
        return self._call_occi(environ, response, security=sec_obj)

Now the *sec_obj* will be passed within the *extras* parameter of the
functions in the backends (to retrieve it: *extras[security]*).

Next to this the OCCI core model *Entity* (and therefore also *Resource* and
*Link*) has an attribute called *extras* which will not be rendered, but can
be used to store any kind of object (such as ownership information).

Notes on Backend Implementations
--------------------------------

.. note::
    The OCCI Infrastructure extension is also implemented and ready to be
    used. Simply write the backends for the Kinds, Mixins and Actions defined
    in the module occi.extension.infrastructure.

.. note::
    A Backend must handle all the kinds it defines. That means that if it
    defines a compute kind and a network resource link kind all the operations
    should have an 'if statement' to check which type of entity is provided to
    the routine.

.. note::
    There are some routines for your convenience which will help you implement
    backends. They are located in the backend module. Please refer to the API
    documentation for more details.

.. note::
    If a backend handles mixins it should verify that mixins can be applied to
    the provided resources.

.. note::
    It is recommended to throw either AttributeError or HTTPErrors on any
    exceptions in the Backends. HTTPErrors can be used if you want to define a
    return code (defined in the wsgi module) or AttribtueErrors on more
    generic errors which will result in a Bad Request.
