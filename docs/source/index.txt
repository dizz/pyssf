Welcome to Service Sharing Facility's documentation!
====================================================

.. note::
    This is still work in progress. For more information and tracking the
    ongoing development go to http://sourceforge.net/projects/pyssf/

This software package is a collection of modules which can be used stand alone
or all together. The tool-suite aims to give you some building blocks to
create service offerings for Grids, Clusters, HPC and Clouds.

All Software presented here falls under an Open Source License - Although
thoroughly tested (100% code/documentation coverage) & worked hard on
`PEP8 <http://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0008/>`_ and pylint compliance
(See the report) we cannot guarantee the absence of bugs - use on your own
risk. But we do value your feedback! Feel free to visit the SourceForge page
and submit issues, features request, ask for support or leave a friendly note.

This tool-suite contains an `OCCI <http://www.occi-wg.org>`_ compatible
implementation and is available on
`pypi <http://pypi.python.org/pypi/pyssf>`_. The support for submitting jobs
through DRMAA using an RESTful OCCI compatible interface is currently updated.
We are working on service for automatic negotiation of SLAs.
